# Apple Sharing

# Create two variables: numStudents and numApples
# Students take apples from a basket and distribute them among each other evenly. The remaining (the undivisible) part remains in the basket.
# How many apples will each single student get? How many apples will remain in the basket?
# Test with 20 apples, 6 students



# Test with 25 apples, 10 students
